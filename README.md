# Northwind-DataMining
Data Mining project of Northwind Sales DB

In order to implement this project, it is used the database named Northwind. This database is created for a wholesale market. The tables contain information such as buyers, sellers, orders, customers, products, product categories. My goal is to use this database to determine which country it have more trade volume, and to identify public relations and advertising operations accordingly. It is included the tables, data, and other content in this database through ETL processes.


Using the graphic in DataMiningProject we have observed in which country our sales are higher. Sales to America, Germany and Brazil are higher, while we have fewer sales to countries such as Poland and Norway. From here I decided that we should re-examine our stock capacities in America and Germany. Apart from this, I have decided to do more advertising work in the countries where I have observed that we sell less.
